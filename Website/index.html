      <h1>Why Did We Choose Sustainability?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-" >For my project I am focusing on sustainability. While this topic is relatively broad, covering things like compost, organic food, local food, and community gardens. As a part of our research we focused on local food and how sustainability is approached from the local side and the business side. We interviewed Tyler Helikson, who is the co-founder of Happy + Hale, and he talked about how the company attacks sustainability while still trying to stay in budget for a business. Second, we interviewed Kay Coleman, who runs a community garden in Raleigh, and she talked about how practicing sustainability can help a community and a family because of how people buy and grow their own food. The main thing that lapsed between both sides of sustainability is the concept of education and accessibility. It is not inexpensive to practice sustainability, so businesses and low-income families have a choice to make between money and eating healthy. The main design problem we face is how we are supposed to get people interested in the topic of sustainability and how to educate them about it. We want to find a way that makes people want to eat healthy or eat locally and motivate them to not only help themselves, but also help the planet. 
</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">For my subject matter, I started broad with the topic of sustainability. The definition of sustainability is a method of harvesting or using a resource so that the resource is not depleted or permanently damaged and using this method to live a certain lifestyle. This definition can split off into several subcategories of human lifestyle and behavior. This term umbrellas things like organic food, locally grown food, composting, community gardens, etc. We started off with the design problem of sustainability and how we can make it accessible and interesting to the public. We noticed that people were starting to become interested in sustainability, it growing popular with people that are, especially, our age and just the growing rise of the public being concerned with what goes into their bodies. The main issue we saw with this was that even though there was an interest in it, people didn’t know how to become educated about it. So, we talked to two very educated people on the topic of sustainability: Kay Coleman and Tyler Helikson. Coleman manages the InterFaith Food Shuttle and Helikson is the co-founder of the Happy + Hale restaurant. With them we could delve into not only the personal aspect of sustainability but the logistics side of it as well.

      <h1>Importance</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Why is sustainability important? Well, we wanted to focus on the food portion of sustainability. According to Harvard’s The Nutritional Source, “As we become a more food-savvy society, consumers are looking beyond the supermarket shelf and exploring how their food is produced. Where does all this food come from? Consider that, for example, livestock production – which includes meat, milk and eggs – contributes 40 percent of global agricultural gross domestic product, and uses one-third of the world’s fresh water. As one article put it, ‘There may be no other single human activity that has a bigger impact on the planet than the raising of livestock.’ It’s clear that what we put on our plates has a big impact on the environment. Eating more healthfully and more sustainably go hand-in-hand, meaning we can develop sustainable eating practices that improve our own health while also benefiting the health of the planet.” </h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">"Sustainability for me means doing no harm to the environment I mean you know it’s important that we help people that are hungry but it’s very important that we are good stewards of our earth and so we have this opportunity to tell people ways you can do that because a lot of people they don’t know that when they spray their yards for mosquitos they are killing bees, it doesn’t even dawn on them and when you say that they’re like “oh!” and so we have the opportunity to share that." - Kay Coleman
